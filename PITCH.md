## Problem
*~15 seconds*

**Millions of teenagers have no idea what to do after school.**

Every year, 15-18 year olds face the same overwhelming question: *"What should I do with my life?"* Traditional career counseling is boring, inaccessible, and doesn't speak their language. Personality tests exist, but they're clinical, confusing, or locked behind paywalls.

**Result:** Young people pick careers randomly, switch majors multiple times, or freeze up entirely—costing them years and thousands in tuition.
